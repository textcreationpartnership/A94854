         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>The Priſoner at the Bar, Mr. <hi>Langhorn,</hi> ſtands Indicted of High Treaſon, &amp; it is for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiring the Murder of the King, &amp; endeavouring an alteration in the Government in Church and State. And the Indictment ſets forth, that the <hi>30th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> in the <hi>30th</hi> year of the King, he &amp; other falſe Traitors did agree to ſtir up Sedition and Rebellion in the kingdom, &amp; to cauſe a great ſlaughter of his Majeſties Subjects; to introduce the Superſtition of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and depoſe and Murther the King, and to alter the Government in Church &amp; State. And 'tis there ſaid that to accompliſh theſe Evil Deſigns, he writ Two Letters to be ſent to <hi>Rome,</hi> and St. <hi>Omers,</hi> the effect of which letters was to procure the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Pope,</hi> &amp; the <hi>French</hi> King, to alter the Religion Eſtabliſhed by Law in this Kingdom, to <hi>Romiſh</hi> Superſtition, to Subvert the government, &amp; to put the King to death; &amp; that in further proſecution of theſe Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous deſigns, he writ Two other letters to be ſent to <hi>Rome</hi> to one <hi>Chriſtopher Anderton,</hi> Rector of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colledge, &amp; a <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> &amp; Two other to be ſent to <hi>St. Omers;</hi> and in theſe letters he took upon him to adviſe the way &amp; means by which theſe treaſons might be effected, &amp; that theſe ſeveral letters were ſent &amp; delivered by him, &amp; received. The indictment further ſets forth that in further proſecution of theſe traiterous imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of his, he did receive 5 ſeveral commiſſions in writing, by authority derived from the <hi>See</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> &amp; thoſe were for the making of military Officers, to execute theſe trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons by force of Arms, &amp; that he did likewiſe receive 5 other Commiſſions for conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Civil Officers in this Realm, after the Treaſon was Committed. And that amongſt the reſt he did receive for himſelf one Commiſſion to be Advocate general of the Army that was to be rais'd. And the Indictment further Charges upon the Priſoner, that to accompliſh theſe treaſons, whereas <hi>Ireland, Pickering</hi> &amp; <hi>Grove,</hi> &amp; other falſe traitors, had conſulted theſe treaſons which I before mentioned, Mr. <hi>Langh</hi> had Notice of the treaſons &amp; did conſent to them &amp; abet them, &amp; that he did ſolicit the <hi>Benedictine</hi> Monks to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance 6000 <abbr>
                     <hi>l.</hi>
                  </abbr> for the murther of the King, for the Alteration of Religion, &amp; for the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the Government in Church and State, And further, whereas <hi>Mr. Coleman,</hi>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:151395:4"/>(who was Executed for Treaſon) had (with others) conſpired the death of the King, and the introducing of Popery, and has writ a letter to the <hi>French</hi> Confeſſor <hi>Le Cheeſe,</hi> for Aid and aſſiſtance, that the Priſoner at the Bar had notice of this, and that he did conſent to it, and did abet it. This, Gentlemen, is charged to be Traiterouſly, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viliſhly done againſt the Priſoners Allegiance, and the form of the Statute. To this he hath pleaded Not Guilty, but if we prove theſe Treaſons, or any of them, you are to find him Guilty.</p>

               <p>This Treaſon was no leſs than to murther the King, to alter the Religion, to overturn the Law, to raiſe an Army, by force to effect all this, and in ſhort to do all the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief that men (if it be lawful to call ſuch creatures men) could do. That there was In order to this, conſultations held the <hi>24th.</hi> of <hi>April</hi> among the Jeſuits; &amp; there it was reſolved that the King ſhould be killed, there were perſons appointed to do it, that was <hi>Pickering</hi> and <hi>Grove,</hi> but they failed therein, and they proſecuted it at <hi>Windſor,</hi> but happening to fail there alſo, they followed him to <hi>New-market,</hi> and ordered that it ſhould be done there: And when all this failed, they took another courſe, his Majeſty was to be poiſoned, and as I ſaid before, to make all this good, an Army was to be raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of 50000 men in <hi>England,</hi> to perfect this work; but if that would not do, they were to have Forces from beyond Sea to joyn with them: And Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi> he writ letters to procure theſe Forces, and he not only did ſo, but he found the effect of his letters, and received Commiſſions from beyond Sea, whereof one was for himſelf, to be Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate general of the Army.

               <p>Mr. <hi>Langh.</hi> it is not a proper Queſtion, we ought not to ask it him: You are a man of the law, and therefore you know it is not fair to ask any perſon a Queſtion about a criminal matter that may bring himſelf in danger.</p>

                  <hi>My</hi> Lord, about three years ſince, I was ſent by <hi>Mr. Harcourt,</hi> and <hi>Mr. Coleman,</hi> to <hi>le Cheiſe,</hi> with ſome letters for the carrying on of this Deſign. With theſe letters, Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> asked me, if I could go with him as far as the <hi>Temple.</hi> I have no particular acquaintance with <hi>Mr. Langhorn,</hi> I was but twice at his Chamber, once with Mr. <hi>Harcourt,</hi> and once with <hi>Mr. Coleman.</hi> I waited upon <hi>Mr. Coleman</hi> to <hi>Mr. Langhorns</hi> Chamber in the <hi>Temple,:</hi> There did he regiſter ſuch letters as <hi>Mr. Coleman</hi> brought to him, and afterwards Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> ſealed them up, and gave them me to carry to <hi>le Cheeſe.</hi>

That the Catholicks of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> were in ſafety had made all Places, and all Offices, to be diſpoſed of to Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, or ſuch as they thought would be ſo; that all Garriſons were either in their
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:151395:10"/>own hands, or ready to be put into them; that they had ſo ſair an opportunity, (as I remember that was one of the expreſſions in the letter to Father <hi>Stapleton.</hi>) that they had ſo fair an opportunity, having a King ſo eaſy to believe what is dictated to him by our Party, that if we ſlip this opportunity, we muſt deſpair of ever introducing Popery into <hi>England;</hi> for having a King of <hi>England</hi> ſo eaſy, and the <hi>French</hi> King ſo powerful, they muſt not miſs ſuch an opportunity.</p>

About a year and a half ſince, Mr. <hi>Harcourt</hi> ſent another Pacquet of letters by me to Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi> to be regiſtred; he looked ſtrangely upon me, and received the letter, and ſent an Anſwer to Mr. <hi>Harcourt,</hi> that Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> (for I went them under the name of Captain <hi>Williams</hi>) had delivered him ſuch letters, and that he ſhould have them again to morrow, after he had copied them, and regiſtred them. Mr <hi>Harcourt</hi> read the letter of Anſwer to me, and in the letter it was Mr. <hi>Williams.</hi> Said I to Maſter <hi>Harcourt,</hi> I thought I might have heen regiſtred by my right name, becauſe when any thing ſhould take effect and occaſion ſerve, I reſolved to bear my own name. Alas, ſays he, this does not ſignifie any thing at all, for as for this Regiſter, it is not ſo conſiderable: there ſhall be a new Regiſter made, of things of weight and moment, this is only a blind Regiſter amongſt our ſelves.

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>We do tell you, that if we had not judged them to be Witneſſes, we would not have heard them.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Langhorn,</speaker>
               <p>They come under the ſame reaſon of Law with an Approver, having had their Pardon; I don't ſay they are directly Approvers, but I conceive they come under the ſame reaſon of Law with them, and then if the Approver be pardoned, by the Law the Appellee ought to be diſcharged; &amp; methinks by the ſame reaſon, theſe men having been <hi>participes Criminis,</hi> and having got their Pardons, ought not to be ſuch ſubſtantial Witneſſes againſt the Priſonet at the Bar. But, my Lord, I have one thing yet further to ask, I deſire to know whether they have not received any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, or Gratifications, for the Diſcovery they have made, and the Service they have done?

And you your ſelf know, that an Approver, while he is in that ſervice, hath a Peny a day, which in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient times was a great matter for livelihood and ſuſtenance; ſo that any Reward that they have, if you can prove it by Contract or Subornation, you cannot make an Objection.</p>

               <p>'Tis pretty reaſonable for us to give a publick ſatisfaction to all the world, that we do nothing under-hand, but that we do in this Caſe as in all other caſes; any thing that is fit to be anſwered, they ſhall anſwer, and perchance in this Caſe ſomething more than can be ſtrictly required of us, 'Tis notorious enough, that Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> have been fed at the Kings charge, and it cannot be objected againſt them, and need not be wink'd at, for they were parties in the Plot. And when they come to make the Diſcovery, without which we ſhould never have known the Plot, for yow know 'tis hard to diſcover any Crime, Forgery, or the like, but by one that hath been privy to it, and a guilty perſon; yet theſe men always have been, and are in Law Witneſſes, and 'tis juſt they ſhould have a Competency to maintain them, ſince they came for the publick Good to make ſuch Diſcoveries.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>North,</hi> And that particular Sum of money was paid to Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> in purſuance of the Kings Proclamation, which we all know, which was all publickly done.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Langhorn,</speaker>
               <p>The Reaſon why <hi>I</hi> preſs this was, becauſe of the Proclamation, which was to invite Perſons to come, touching the diſcovery of this Plot; and to encourage them to it by a promiſe of reward. <hi>I</hi> think it may be reaſonable enough, where any perſon that is charged with a Crime doth abſent, to propoſe a Reward for the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him in. But <hi>I</hi> think it is hard, that when a Priſoner is in Cuſtody, Witneſſes ſhould be brought in againſt him by ſuch means.</p>

                  <hi>I</hi> muſt tell your Lordſhip, my whole Defence muſt run to diſable the Witneſſes, for my Lord <hi>I</hi> was committed to <hi>Newgate</hi> the 17th of <hi>October,</hi> and <hi>I</hi> have been kept there a cloſe Priſoner till this day was ſeven-night, or Friday the laſt week, <hi>I</hi> never converſed with any Friend, or any Relation, nor knew any thing of News, only with ſome few perſons ſent by Authority of the Houſe of Commons or the Council.

               <p>But you ſee how unfortunately it happens, the matter had not been much, if it had been proved; but it is very unlucky that theſe perſons ſhould be here in Court by whom the other is contradicted, it had been better it were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver medled with.

               <p>Since he gave not any occaſion or uſe for ſuch a proof now at this time, 'tis not ſit he ſhould be examined about it: Indeed yeſterday he gave it in Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, becauſe it concerned a circumſtance of time that related to the Priſoners the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Look you, here is the thing, he gives you an Anſwer to which he was not in the leaſt bound, nor is it to be charged by you; he ſayes he is out 700 l. but that is not any Evidence, nor is the Jury to take notice of it, nor is it to affect him.

               </speaker>
               <p>My Lord &amp; Gentlemen of the Jury, you have heard the Evidence that Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi> hath given for the making of his defence, which hath been principally to reflect upon Mr. <hi>Oates;</hi> and he firſt calls mr. <hi>Hilſly</hi> to prove that whereas mr. <hi>Oates</hi> did ſwear he came over with him, he affirms he did not; but it falls out, that mr, <hi>Oates</hi> hath counterproved him by ſuch a circumſtance as does contradict him in what he ſays; for ſpeaking of the loſs of his money, <hi>Hilſly</hi> ſaid, ſome body elſe had told him of it; but producing his Witneſs for that, he only offirms, that Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> in his company was told, that mr. <hi>Hilſly</hi> had loſt his money, but not how nor where; but mr. <hi>Oates</hi> gives you a particular circumſtance, that he was cheated by a perſon he lent his money to, and that left him to pay the reckoning, which m. <hi>Hilſly</hi> does confeſs was true, and which he could not hear from the others, for the others did never know it Gentlemen, they have brought you a great many other witneſſes to prove, that Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> was not in <hi>England</hi> on the 24th of <hi>April,</hi> the time he ſays he was, and they all agree to that time, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ho' as to other times they are not ſo exact; but we ſhall give you as plain and as full an Evidence that he was here at that time as that you are there now, and ſhall very fully ſatisfie you in it For that of Sir <hi>John Warner,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Proſton</hi> they are matters, that were tranſacted beyond Sea, to be ſure they did not come over by thoſe Names, no more did mr. <hi>Oates</hi> himſelf; therefore it would be hard to find out theſe Perſons, or to give you ſo particular an account of them that were thus in Diſguiſes, and had changed their Names: but truly if that were a matter done in <hi>England,</hi> it were far more eaſie for us to confront their Teſtimony in that; for matters that are done here <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ye more ready for our proof than thoſe that are done beyond <hi>Sea;</hi> for the laſt woman that he called which was the woman about the <hi>White Horſe</hi> Tavern, her Evidence
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:151395:24"/>would have gone as punctually for truth, if it had been a matter done in <hi>Flanders</hi> as any thing could be in the world: but it happening to be near home, it hath the ill fortune to meet with a very ſudden Anſwer, which is a manifeſt proof how they ſtretch to help themſelves, and in my opinion this contradiction overthrows all their Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Gentlemen, we will call our Witneſſes, and prove it as plainly as any thing can be in the world, that <hi>Mr. Oates</hi> was here at that time. Firſt ſwear <hi>VVill.

               <p>I ſaw him the latted end of <hi>March</hi> 1678. or towards the middle of <hi>April</hi> following, I ſaw him then in a diſguiſe, in ſo much as that I knowing what he was &amp; what he had been I could not a great while recollect the face of the man, &amp; it was a great trouble tom, that having known him ſo many years, I ſhould not then know him. <hi>I</hi> went home, but could not recollect my ſelf that night; but before I roſe again the next morning I did recollect my ſelf that it was <hi>Titus Oats,</hi> and I preſently turned my ſelf out of my bed and went to a Gentlewon an whoſe name I did not then well know to inquire of her about it. After the Salutation, ſaid I, How does <hi>Mr Oats</hi> ſaid ſhe, knocking her hand upon the Counter, He is an undone man: VVhy, what is the matter, ſaid I, He is turned, ſaid ſhe, to the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> Do you know where he is, ſaid I? No, ſaid ſhe, but he is lurking up and down the Town, and only dares appear in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Well then, ſaid I, I ſaw him later than you did; for I ſaw him between St. <hi>Martins</hi> lane and <hi>Leiceſter</hi> houſe yeſterday, but he was in a diſguiſe and I told her what habit he was in.</p>

               <p>And that contradicts all your Witneſſes; for they ſay, that he was there all <hi>March</hi> and all <hi>April</hi> and all <hi>May,</hi> nay from <hi>December</hi> to <hi>June.</hi>

               <speaker>Lord Chief Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>He cannot be certain; for thoſe things in point of time, you know and all mankind muſt agree, that a thing done a year ago that was of no greater im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance at that time, cannot ſo eaſily be remembred, or that he ſhould take ſuch ſpecial notice of the critical day. What man in the world does remember or take notice ſo as to charge himſelf in what week or what month ſuch an accidental thing as this happened? But to ſatisfie <hi>M. Langhorn I</hi> ask you, can you ſpeak any more particularly than you have done?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Walker.</speaker>
               <p>Becauſe <hi>I</hi> would not be miſtaken or do any one any wrong, <hi>I</hi> do rather take an uncertain time then a certain, but <hi>I</hi> do think it was in the month of <hi>April,</hi> and towards the middle of the month, that is all <hi>I</hi> can ſay.</p>

               <p>Yes, my <hi>Lord;</hi> for according to my apprehenſion I did know the face when I firſt ſaw it, but <hi>I</hi> could not recollect who it was till <hi>I</hi> had refreſhed my memory, and the next morning I did ſo, and then concluded it was he.</p>

Said I, mr. <hi>Oates</hi> you are welcome into <hi>England</hi> again, but he took no notice but went forward into the houſe, but he made but a little ſtay there, and came out again; it ſeems ſomebody had affronted him, and laughed at him, becauſe he was more like a Shepherd than a Miniſter: His hair was cut and had a gray Coat on, and plain Shooes, and a flopping Hat, and ſo he went out of the Gate, and would not take any notice of me, or what I ſaid.</p>

               <speaker>Langhorn,</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I am charged here by two Witneſſes, the firſt is <hi>Mr Oates?</hi> If I can prove any one point (in anſwer to that which he hath given in Evidence) not to be
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:151395:27"/>true, then I conceive, my Lord, he ought to be ſet aſide: And I think it hath been clearly proved. That whereas he ſaid Sir <hi>Tho. Preſton</hi> came over with him in <hi>April,</hi> it hath been clearly proved he was then at L <hi>ige;</hi> and whereas he hath affirmed, Sir <hi>John Warner,</hi> Mr. <hi>Poole,</hi> and two or three more that were at St. <hi>Omers</hi> came over with him, I have proved that not to be true beyond any contradiction: Then, as the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes about his own not coming over in <hi>April. Mr. Hilſly</hi> ſays he came not over with him in the Pacquet Boat; and the other ſays that he was ſick in the Infirmary after Mr. <hi>Hilſly</hi> came away: Theſe points being thus proved, I think there can be no credit given to what he ſays; for I can ſay, and I know it to be truth, that from <hi>November</hi> 1677, to this very day I never ſaw him: I have been a cloſe Priſoner ſo long, and have had but one weeks time to provide, and therefore muſt be ſain to take ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation as my Friends and Relations could pick up, to anſwer what he hath ſaid in his Narratives, ſuppoſing he would have ſaid the ſame here; therefore I am not able to make any better defence.</p>

               <speaker>Lang.</speaker>
               <p>He brought me a letter from one of my Sons, my younger Son in <hi>Spain,</hi> and then he told me he was going to St. <hi>Omers.</hi> He ſaid he could not be ſettled in any of the Colledges in <hi>Spain,</hi> and therefore he would go to St. <hi>Omers:</hi> and from that day I never ſaw him till I ſaw him in the Court: I hope truly I have well proved that he was not here in <hi>England</hi> when he ſays he was, but that I muſt leave to the Jury: But ſurely theſe Boys cannot be ſuppoſed to have any deſign, or to be bribed by any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, for I never ſaw the Face of any of them till now.</p>

Then they bring the Woman of the <hi>White-Horſe</hi>-Tavern, where the Conſult of the twenty fourth of <hi>April</hi> was; and what is the uſe they would make of her? why it is, that Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> ſhould make a ſtory of Fifty Fathers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in her Tavern at one time (but he inſiſts now, there was a matter of twenty) when there was not a Room in her Houſe that would hold Ten: But you hear how ſhe was Anſwered, from Teſtimony riſing up in the Court of themſelves that were acquainted with her Houſe, and know, that forty people may dine in two of her Rooms: And the Kings Counſel obſerved well, how chance it ſelf hath put to ſilence this evidence. So that when matters are alledged to be done at home, there is not ſo great a difficulty as in proving things that are done <hi>abroad.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I leave it to you Sirs. Here is a <hi>Gentleman</hi> that ſtands at the Bar upon his life on the one Hand: but if mr. <hi>Oates</hi> ſay true, all our lives, and Liberties, our King and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, are at the Stake on the other Hand. God defend that Innocent Blood ſhould be ſhed, and God defend us alſo from all Popiſh Plots, and from all the bloody principles of Papiſts; which are very Cruel as we know by experience; and you cannot blame <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:151395:30"/>to look to our ſelves. For I muſt tell you, the Plot is proved as plain as the day, and that by <hi>Oates,</hi> and farther, <hi>Oates</hi> Teſtimony is confirmed by that which can never be Anſwered. For when he comes at his firſt Teſtimony and ſays that upon the twenty fourth of <hi>April</hi> ſuch a Conſult was ſummoned and held, it falls out that five days after a Letter is found amongſt <hi>Harcourts</hi> papers, (a principal Perſon in the Deſign) which does order the meeting upon the twenty fourth of <hi>April,</hi> bing the day after St. <hi>Georges</hi> Feaſt, and gives them a Caution that they ſhould not come too ſoon to Town; That they ſhould not appear too much in <hi>London</hi> for fear of diſcovering the <hi>Deſign,</hi> And of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſing <hi>that, the nature of which requires Secrecy.</hi> Plainer than this is hardly to be writ from a Jeſuit, Eſpecially in ſo dangerous a matter. And what can be anſwered to this Letter that is found in a Prieſts Hand four days after Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> had given in his Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation about it?</p>
               <p>Put all this together, and if you be ſatisfied herein, you may judg the better, as to the particular buſineſs of mr. <hi>Langhorn,</hi> how far the Teſtimony, of <hi>Oates</hi> and Bedlow affect him. You know what you do. And for <hi>Bedloe</hi> 'tis true what he ſays, that there is nothing to be ſaid to his Evidence, becauſe no man can prove a Negative; and he ſwears expreſly that he had this diſcourſe with him of theſe Treaſonable matters, Killing the King, and Altering Religion. If this be ſo, and you are ſatisfied in that particular (and that a man may very well bee as to the ſubſtance) I do not ſee any conſiderable Anſwer that is given. <hi>I</hi> ſay once more, there is the life of a Gentleman at ſtake, and there are all our lives at the ſtake: Follow you your conſciences; do Wiſely, do Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, and conſider what is to be done,</p>

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:151395:30"/>
                  <hi>Deſign</hi> was?

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Langhorn,</speaker>
               <p>My, Lord, I will tell you what I take to be the meaning of that letter. The deſign was the holding of a Congregation: There were diverſe of them, and it was like the meeting of a Dean and Chapter in a Colledge, and he bids them not to come too long before the time, for they were certainly in very great danger to be taken,</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C, J,</speaker>
               <p>What! At that time? What danger were they in then?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Langhorn.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, my Lord, the Parliament was then ſitting.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>But you know what Indulgence there was to all <hi>Papiſts</hi> at that time, if they would be but quiet. Well but put it altogether, they were to come to <hi>London, not too ſoon, nor to appear too much,</hi> becauſe the Parliament was ſitting <hi>for fear of Diſcovering the Deſign.</hi> What, was that only for <hi>Mr. Whitebread,</hi> and his fellows, to make an Officer Can it be anſwered by that:</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Langhorn,</speaker>
               <p>Certainly their holding of a Congregation in <hi>England,</hi> does require ſecrecy.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Gentlemen! Here is the thing, This is only an Evidence to the Plot, in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, that there is a Plot, and you may make what reaſonable uſe you think fit of it. It is not a Particular Evidence againſt Mr. <hi>Langhorns</hi> particular perſon, Only it ſhews there was a Plot, and you have heard what they ſay to him in particular about it. And I'le tell you one thing more, which if <hi>Oats</hi> ſwears true, concerns you very much. He ſaith they were a talking of the Ten Thouſand Pounds that Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi> was to have for Poyſoning the King when their other attempts had failed, and that he would not take under. Fifteen Thouſand Pound. You mr. <hi>Langhorn,</hi> was very angry,, and ſaid it was a baſe covetous thing in him; and it being ſuch a public Cauſe, it would have been no matter if he had done it for Nothing. <hi>I</hi> have repeated as much as I can well remember without any prejudice to Mr. <hi>Langhorns</hi> Teſtimony. And ſo I leave it with you:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Than an Officer was Sworn to keep the Jury, who withdrew to conſider of their Verdict, and the Judges alſo went off from the Bench. The</hi> Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>telling the Auditory, that the day being ſo far ſpent, and the Commiſſion determining that night, becauſe of the Term, Sir</hi> George Wakeman <hi>and the reſt could not be tryed till next Seſſions. And after a ſhort ſpace, the Jury returned, and anſwering to their Names, delivered in their Verdict.</hi>

               <speaker>Mr. Recorder</speaker>
               <p>You, the Priſoners at the Bar: You have been ſeverally Araigned, and now are ſeverally Convicted of High Treaſon. And that attended with all the ill cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances that can be poſſible to aggravate ſo High a crime. You attempted the Life of the beſt of Kings; who was full of mercy and Compaſſion even to you, under whom you might ſtill have lived peaceably and quietly, had not your own Malice and Miſchiefs prevented it. Nor were you ſatisfied with that alone; for you intended there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to make way for the Deſtruction of the greateſt part of the Kingdom, by a Publick Maſſacre, by cutting the Throats of all <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> for that alſo appears to be your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne: To effect which, the neareſt way, and the heſt means you could think of, was firſt to kill the King. And this was to be done, for the introducing of another Religion as you call it; which, as we think, we more properly call Superſtition; and ſo root out the beſt Religion that is Eſtabliſhed amongſt us by Law. And <hi>I</hi> therefore call it the beſt of Religions even for your ſakes; for had it not been for the ſake of our Religion, that teaches us not to make ſuch Requitals, as yours ſeems to teach you, you had not had that fair formal way of Tryal, and of being Heard, as you now have been; but mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der would have been returned to you, for the murder you intended to commit both up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the King, and moſt of his people. What a ſtrange ſort of Religion is that, whoſe Doctrine ſeems to allow them to be the greateſt Saints in another World, that can be the moſt Impudent Sinners in this? murder, and the Blackeſt Crimes here, are the beſt means among you, to get a man to be Canonized a ſaint hereafter. Is it not ſtrange, that men profeſſed in Religion, that uſe all eadeavours to gain Proſelytes for heaven, ſhould ſo pervert the Scripture. (as <hi>I</hi> perceive, ſome of you have done) and make that Juſtify your Impious Deſignes of Aſſaſſinating Kings, and murdering their Subjects?
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:151395:31"/>What can be ſaid to ſuch a ſort of People, the very Foundation of whoſe Religion is laid in Blood? Nay, leſt you ſhould not be able ſo eaſily to perſwade them ſo cleverly to imbibe thoſe Bloody Principles, you do abſolve them from all the Obligations that they remain under, of Obedience to their Soveraign; You do therefore from the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits publickly teach, That the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy, ſignifie nothing. It's a ſtrange Religion, that applies every thing to theſe wicked and deteſtable purpoſes.</p>
               <p>There is one Gentleman that ſtands at the Bar, whom I am very ſorry to ſee with all my heart in this condition, becauſe of ſome acquaintance I have had with him here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore: To ſee a man who hath Underſtanding in the Law, and who hath arrived to ſo great an Eminency in that Profeſſion, as that Gentleman hath done, ſhould not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that 'tis not only againſt the Rules of all Chriſtianity, but even againſt the Rules of his Profeſſion, to attempt any injury againſt the Perſon of the King.
